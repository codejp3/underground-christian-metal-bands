# underground-christian-metal-bands

This is a fork of the original underground-christian-metal-bands from "Beyond the Grave".

It appears to be defunt, or abandoned.

This fork is for me to play around with the data collected, and import into a Christian Metal DB site that should be launchig before the end of 2022.


# You're making ANOTHER Christian Metal website???

Yes. What I'm creating is very different than what's currently available. 

It is a metadata collection site that reaches out to various APIs, Music DBs, Music Hosting Sites, and non-traditional sources like this Github project. It then consolidates all of that data to build out the most complete information available for every Artist/Album/Song added. Once that info is built-up, it will then push updates out to the various APIs/DBs/Sites to give Christian (metal/hardcore/rock) bands better coverage and exposure.
